I am a PhD candidate with a background of musculoskeletal physiotherapy based in Australia. In 2023, I embarked on thais journey to better understand advances in musculoskeletal imaging. With a group of researchers from around the globe, I have learnt to develop new MRI analysis tools and am excited to collaborate with anyone with the same passion as I have.
