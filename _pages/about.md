I am a PhD candidate with a background of musculoskeletal physiotherapy based in Australia. In 2023, I embarked on thais journey to better understand advances in musculoskeletal imaging. With a rag tag group of researchers around the globe, I have learnt to develop new MRI analysis tools and am excited to collaborate with anyone with the same passion as I have.

Like many other quantitiative PhD students, I am trapped in a love-hate relationship with coding. Lucky for me, this Jekyll-based GitHub Pages template made it super simple to create something.
